            I have walked many different paths in my life. Welder, tile setter,
            screenprinter, wildland firefighter, jeweler, and even an aneasthesia 
            technician when I was in my early 20s.
        </p> 

        <p>
            I have been a drummer for most of my life and most recently played the band 
            <a href="https://strangeweatherpdx.bandcamp.com/">Strangweather</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
            I have a wonderful Pitbull named Harvey who might be the most pure and
            enlightened creature on Earth.
        </p>
